        Although I was born in Florida, I've spent most of my life up untill now living here
        in Georgia. I've always been a big fan of video games and other computer based media
        so although I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life for the longest time (if you
        can even say that I have it figured out) it only makes sense that I would end up studying
        computational media. Upon arriving at Georgia Tech, I was an architecture major. I originally
        had grand ideas of designing the next great American cities but this was before I realized that
        I'm not good at architecture. At the same time I had taken the mandatory CS class and thought it
        was fun so I decided to take the next CS class. And the next one, and the next one. By the end of
        my 3rd semester I decided to change majors to CM and I plan to enter into the video game industry
        after my graduation. I've already made a few games in CS 2261 for the GBA. You can find a video
        of my last game in the <br><a href="MyCodingExperience.html">my coding experience</a> section of this
        website as well as some other coding facts about me.
